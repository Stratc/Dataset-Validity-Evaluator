# Dataset Validity Evaluator

A computer science project, that evaluates an input data set. After it evaulates the dataset it creates a graph!

## Glossary

_Machine learning: An "algorithm" that takes inputs in and produces an output with hidden layers of calculations_

_Neural network: The "algorithm" that the machine learning program uses_

_Data set: A set of datat that the Neural network uses as inputs._

_Accuracy: The amount of correctly classifed testing inputs from the dataset_



## Steps to install and use

1. Install the tensor flow library.

>[!WARNING]
> **If you do NOT install the tensor flow library into the python ide the compiler will output lots of errors.**

2. Download the python file.

3. Put the python file into some sort of complier to run the python file.

4. Let the program run. It has only been tested on linux and windows based systems.

5. Watch as the graph gets produced if on a desktop, otherwise it will be saved to the system. The outputs are also printed to the console so you can check there if you want to see the direct values of the Neural network.
   
6. If you would like to save the graph you download. It will **NOT** save the graph automatically you have to do this manually.



### Output example graph
This is an example image of an outputted graph from the program. This graph is the same exact one as on the physical board
