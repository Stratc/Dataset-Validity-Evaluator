# Dataset Validity Evaluator

A computer science project, that evaluates an input data set. After it evaulates the dataset it creates a graph!

To use:
Step 1: Download the python file.

Step 2: Put the python file into some sort of complier to run the python file.

Step 3: Let the program run. It has only been tested on linux and windows based systems.

Step 4: Watch as the graph gets produced if on a desktop, otherwise it will be saved to the system. The outputs are also printed to the console so you can check there if you want to see the direct values of the Neural network.

## Glossary

Machine learning: An "algorithm" that takes inputs in and produces an output with hidden layers of calculations

Neural network: The "algorithm" that the machine learning program uses

Data set: A set of datat that the Neural network uses as inputs.

Accuracy: The amount of correctly classifed testing inputs from the dataset
